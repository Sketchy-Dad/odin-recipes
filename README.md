Will be conducting an HTML Recipe List for The Odin Project!

Will be using the Linux Terminal to create the Folders/Files/pages that will all be linked accordingly with GitHub with a remote clone of the repository to my local machine.

To build the Recipe List I will use unordered and ordered lists with
 associated images, proper headings and hyperlinks.
